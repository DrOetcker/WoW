Step 1 :
Lockpicking lvl 0-101 - Redridge mountains, Alther's Mill.  http://db.vanillagaming.org/?object=178244  Recommended lvl is 20. Alliance can do their rogue quest here as well along with these. Don't use your pets here while opening these boxes.

Step 2 :
Lockpicking lvl 101-103 - Westfall, Defias tower. Duskwood chest http://db.vanillagaming.org/?object=123214  This is alliance rogue quest. Horde can skip this and move directly to step 3. Recommended lvl is 30. Do not use your pet here.

Step 3 :
Lockpicking lvl 103-125 - Stranglethorn Vale. Pickpocket and kill Skullsplitter warriors and mystics  http://db.vanillagaming.org/?npc=667 || http://db.vanillagaming.org/?npc=780  You will obtain worn junkboxes from these mobs. These should save you gold on poisons and the mobs should give you great xp. Recommended lvl is 38. http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=16883

Step 4 :
Lockpicking lvl 125-165 - Wetlands, North of Menethil Harbor. The battered footlockers here should do nicely.  http://db.vanillagaming.org/?object=179488  The mobs around these items are very easy to clear. Recommended lvl is 45.

Step 5 :
Lockpicking lvl 165-201 - Desolace, North east part of Sar'theris strand. Waterlogged footlockers http://db.vanillagaming.org/?object=179491 The mobs around these items are easy to clear and very few. An elixir of waterbreathing  http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=5996  can be used to speeden things up. Recommended lvl is 49.

Step 6 :
Lockpicking lvl 201-225 - Swamp of sorrows, Pool of tears. Mossy footlockers http://db.vanillagaming.org/?object=179493  The mobs around these items are hardly 1 or 2 which are cleared easily. An elixir of waterbreathing can be used to speeden things up. Recommended lvl is 50.

Step 7 :
Lockpicking lvl 225-253 - Searing gorge, slag pit. Go to the bottom area with the slave workers. Dented footlockers http://db.vanillagaming.org/?object=179494 Recommended lvl is 55. You can try the footlockers on the upper levels as well but, you might ganked by 2-3 mobs here easily. And they hit rogues hard. Stealth through them to the lower level.

Step 8 :
Lockpicking lvl 253-255 - Searing gorge, stonewrought pass door. This is towards the north east of the map. You can lockpick it now for a skill level. That's right, you don't need a key anymore !  http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Stonewrought_Pass

Step 9 :
Lockpicking lvl 255-300 - Eastern Plaguelands, Tyr's Hand. Scarlet footlockers http://db.vanillagaming.org/?object=179498   There are some footlockers here that are away from the line of sight of any scarlet patrollers. Level away to glory on these. Recommended lvl is 60. Other options here are the doors that you lockpick in BRD or open lockboxes for players or guildies. I found this way the fastest with 0 problems.

And there you have it, lockpicking lvl 300 in 9 steps for alliance and 8 steps for horde.  Cool
